I'm now into my 4th week here at [The Iron Yard, Durham](https://www.theironyard.com/locations/durham.html). So far I have been learning Ruby and the associated tools for writing and deploying apps that we make. I'm getting familiar with [Git](https://github.com/thomftz) and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). I have enjoyed getting back into using the terminal and I think [Atom](https://atom.io/) is a fantastic editor. After learning the hand coded way to include SQL databases into our Ruby apps, we introduced the ORM, ActiveRecord to manage a lot of the connection and table association issues. That process really clicked with me, and connecting the object oriented part of Ruby with a DSL like [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) was fun to work at.

I still feel like I've got so far to go before I'm going to be able to do this for a living though. We get introduced to new tools and concepts so quick that when we were given a coding problem to solve today, I just stared at my editor like I didn't know how to write anything. I have written enough code at this point where I can copy and paste certain elements without thinking about why I'm doing it. I want to try to slow down a bit and write my code with a slow and measured approach to see if I can accomplish certain functions with a cleaner aesthetic and a better developed logic.

I also want to learn a bit of JavaScript in the next couple of weeks. We had our first project last week where we combine the Front End and the Back End classes together to work on an interactive API. It was my first real look at what JavaScript does line by line, and I had several ideas for how to approach different problems on the front end of an application. My 5 year goal is to be Full Stack. JavaScript is definitely going to be a language I can't live without, and I'd rather get started on it while my brain is in learning mode.

We're starting to talk about the real end goal of all this work too - the jay oh bee. I've spent a bit of time updating my resume, and working on a portfolio site too. I've got so many littered repositories on GitHub that need the code cleaned up (or actually finished) that I could spend at least a week on just that. We've had several speakers come in to talk about different aspects of the industry, and the tools that they use. That has been really helpful to bridge the gap between the academic and the real world, and although I'm feeling unprepared for the next step, it's helpful to see that this is a field where learning is the default mode.

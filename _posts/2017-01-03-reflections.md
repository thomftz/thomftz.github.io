This was not how my twenty seventeen was supposed to start. I was planning on getting hired by the local government in my town and start working as a GIS technician. The Friday before Xmas though, I got a letter from the town, "thanks but no thanks".

So now Plan B. I've decided on following my dream of writing code for a living. I've always enjoyed coding, although I'm not even at an amateur level. I knew finishing my B.S. in computer science wasn't an option, so I looked into these new coding schools that are basically 21st century trade schools. Within the past two weeks I've been able to apply for classes, get financing, and tomorrow I'll be moving to Durham for 12 weeks to learn how to code in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) at [The Iron Yard](https://www.theironyard.com/locations/durham.html).

Aside from living arrangements, there has been some pre-work assigned before the first day of class. Although I'm somewhat familiar with the software and processes involved in writing and deploying code, it's been over 5 years since I've looked at any of it. Reviewing concepts in how to interact with computer through the command line and basic HTML/CSS were more challenging than I anticipated. It all started to come back to me, but it's true that if you don't use it, you lose it. Learning Git and basic Ruby concepts is a bit more complicated for me since I process what I learn through using the technology. The method for learning these concepts is interactive, so I was able to "break it" to understand it better. The difficulties in picking up the code have been discouraging, but not enough to dissuade me from learning it.

I'm really excited to be immersed in the learning and development process, and I hope that I'll be able to keep pace with the work. I usually take a bit longer to learn something because I have to experience not just the success of making something work, but also all the different ways that you can break  it too. I'm very much looking forward to working with a team to build a useful web app, because the ends help me achieve the means.

All this is good and worthwhile, but for me, unless I can get a job afterwards it's an expensive detour. I plan on taking full advantage of all the opportunities The Iron Yard offers for employment development. I'm not sure what sort of profile companies look for in a developer, but I want to be ready after the 3 months. I want to be well into a career after a year and in a senior position in 5-7 years.

This is something I've been hoping to do for years - I'm super stoked to have the chance.
